## Synopsis
High frequency trading. But not the way that FinTech companies are doing - thousands of trades per hour, dependent on high-speed connection and execution. Rather, we're trading on lower-frequency volatility, in smaller dollar amounts.

Currently unclear whether it will be strictly stocks, coins, or a mix of both. 

Multiple parts:

1. API to scrape and collate data. Store in database. Thinking Elixir/MySQL, running on raspberry pi.
1. Analysis and simulation. Things to consider:
11. First layer: modeling single good.
11. Second layer: multiple goods.
11. Third layer: mixing trading strategies.
11. Sampling frequency.
11. Return requirements and stop losses.

## Notes


## Next Steps
1. MySQL Server
1. Elixir API
11. Grab multiple tickets, store in db.
11. Run on Raspberry pi
1. Modeling and simulation. Probably in Python for ease and speed.


## Requirements
1. Elixir
2. Postgres
3. Phoenix?
4. Python3
5. Node.js (for phoenix?)


## Tests
None yet.
